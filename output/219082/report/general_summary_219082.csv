A hybrid hero-collector with auto-battle combat plus a light tycoon/management side loop. Early test generosity aside, players report weak combat feedback, poor balance (elemental meta skewed), shallow management, and late-game paywalls that undermine progression and competitiveness. Historical/aesthetic choices also sparked sensitivity concerns.

Breakdown:
- Sensitive Content (q1 - q2)
  • Complaints about sexualized cover art and male‑gaze fanservice clashing with a serious Huaxia theme.  
  • Repeated calls to respect history, avoid distortion or agenda‑driven portrayals; some question including Goryeo as a major culture and whether the style can pass review.

- Gameplay (q3 - q20)
  • Combat satisfaction: Negative. Elemental counters feel ineffective; higher‑power teams can lose unexpectedly; survivability inconsistent.  
  • Balance/meta: Metal lineups dominate; Water is weak; Nezha is very strong; role definitions (tank/healer/DPS) feel unclear.  
  • Team diversity: Limited by the skewed element meta despite a 33‑hero test roster.  
  • Progression: Mixed‑to‑negative due to balance frustrations and perceived randomness in outcomes.  
  • Secondary loop: Matches tycoon/crafting. Simple but shallow/linear, long timers, low restaurant income, excessive clicking; limited customization; one‑building‑at‑a‑time upgrades.  
  • Secondary loop rewards: Underwhelming.

- LiveOps & Retention Systems (q21 - q22)
  • Perceived very low update cadence; no concrete details provided.

- Monetization & Game Economy (q23 - q30)
  • Gacha: Has pity (report of 400‑pull pity for top‑tier “heaven” units; some hit earlier). Pull price sentiment N/A.  
  • Access for non‑payers: Negative. Key resources gated by premium shop; dynasty upgrades require shop items; rankings correlate with spend.  
  • Spending pressure: Moderate‑to‑heavy, especially mid/late game; small early spends feel okay but scale sharply later.

- Anti-P2W Mechanism (q31 - q32)
  • Test phase was generous (many free pulls/currency, easy low‑rarity acquisition), which softened P2W pressure.  
  • Players worry generosity won’t carry to launch; no structural anti‑P2W safeguards noted beyond temporary freebies.

- IP Integration (q33 - q36)
  • N/A.

- System Requirement (q37 - q40)
  • N/A.

- Other Issues (q41)
  • N/A."
