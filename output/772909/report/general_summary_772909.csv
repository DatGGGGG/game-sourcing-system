A cozy micro‑world life sim with light co‑op set pieces and a charming “gather–craft–decorate–dress up” fantasy. Early sentiment favors non‑grindy progression and social play, but the demo feels shallow, core loops aren’t well explained, monetization plans are unclear, and players are highly wary of gacha/P2W. Launch timing, platform clarity, and optimization remain open questions.

Breakdown:
- Sensitive Content (q1 - q2)
  - N/A

- Gameplay (q3 - q20)
  - Core: Small‑team co‑op akin to It Takes Two; scripted rides (e.g., teacup rafting) with movement + attacks; optional AI teammates (reduced rewards); hints of higher‑difficulty team content.
  - Strategy: Human‑city stealth heists with collateral risk/reward (lose loot and stake if detected), yielding décor for home.
  - Secondary loop: Explore to gather sunlight/flower scent/dew; farm/fish/cook; craft items and outfits; decorate a desk‑world; day/night and weather; minigames/instances; friend visits and gifting; daily check‑ins; odd jobs/stalls for coins.
  - Depth/signals: Progression praised as non‑grindy and dress‑up friendly; building and NPC interaction judged too simple; resource loop delightful but under‑explained, with fears it could be bypassed by monetization. Hero balance/build diversity: N/A.

- LiveOps & Retention Systems (q21 - q22)
  - N/A

- Monetization & Game Economy (q23 - q30)
  - Gacha details unknown. Community strongly resists heavy spending and blind boxes; preference for cosmetics‑only, clearly priced items (Honor of Kings‑like benchmarks), reasonable bundles, earnable event rewards, and minimal recharge prompts. Concern that monetization could replace resource acquisition.

- Anti-P2W Mechanism (q31 - q32)
  - N/A; players explicitly demand anti‑P2W, generous freebies, and full feature access without paywalls.

- IP Integration (q33 - q36)
  - Existing momo plush costume collab; depth is skin‑level. Players want deeper/two‑way tie‑ins (e.g., with Tiandao), including themed outfits, furniture, mounts.

- System Requirement (q37 - q40)
  - No concrete ratings; concerns about PV vs real gameplay fidelity, mobile performance (lighting/effects), stability, camera/motion‑sickness options, vertical play preference, and PC/Steam parity; interest in cloud/emulator support.

- Other Issues (q41)
  - Unclear test/release timing and download availability; uncertainty about online co‑op; suspicion of “PV scam”; desire for clean UI (no red dots/recharge pop‑ups); character proportions criticized; requests for deeper face customization; dislike of vacuum pickup (want one‑tap); world scale/openness concerns; limit scattered minigames; OST interest; questions on age rating/story tone; skepticism toward Tencent’s long‑term operations."
