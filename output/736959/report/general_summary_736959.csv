A tactically ambitious 6v6 SRPG with standout action‑bar, speed tuning, scripting, and in‑battle rewind, but undermined by forced manual play, early meta imbalance (burn), stingy post‑newbie rewards, heavy spending pressure, divisive BL/otome reinterpretation of the Three Kingdoms IP, slow content cadence, and rough technical/QoL polish. Later patches improved balance and welfare somewhat, yet core progression, monetization, and operations remain pain points.

- Breakdown:
   + Sensitive Content (q1 - q2)
     BL themes and male‑male CP (notably Cao Cao × Yuan Shao) are prominent; sexualized designs, drinking scenes, bullying/abuse depictions, and ideological/political accusations recur. Many Three Kingdoms fans view the BL/otome tone as disrespectful; some request more male fanservice while others object to it entirely.
   + Gameplay (q3 - q20)
     Core: 6v6 on a 3×3 grid with shared energy, action‑bar push/pull, speed tuning, environmental interactions, and programmable auto‑logic; rewind supports experimentation. Strategic depth is real but often feels gated by stats, forced manual stages, clumsy auto AI, and slow pacing. PvP is unpopular (slow RT, matchmaking, speed openers dominate); early “Fire Burn” comps and backline sniping warped balance, though later counters/teams (poison/Hua Tuo, Wang Yi, Pang Tong) improved diversity. Progression is harsh: after ~2 weeks, resource income collapses, multi‑team requirements kick in, gear reforging is grindy, and roster gating walls PvE. Secondary loop is light (quick daily chores, fishing, hammer forging) with low resource output.
   + LiveOps & Retention Systems (q21 - q22)
     Early cadence felt sparse with frequent droughts and minimal holiday events; communication perceived as weak. Later months added events/balance fixes and more welfare, but overall production speed and meta stewardship still read as slow.
   + Monetization & Game Economy (q23 - q30)
     Gacha has pity (~50 on standard; wishlist/faction guarantees; limited 50/50 then guaranteed), but pulls feel expensive and “permanent half‑price” messaging is disliked. Spending pressure is heavy: post‑newbie income won’t fund regular 10‑pulls, multi‑team demands, limited banners/dupe needs, statted skins, and even auction‑only heroes drive costs. Battle pass value and channel pricing disparities draw criticism; stamina and key bottlenecks are monetized.
   + Anti-P2W Mechanism (q31 - q32)
     Free rewards are frontloaded (first 7–14 days) then thin; no daily free single, tiny task payouts, and event freebies seen as meager. Some servers/updates improved welfare (occasional free skins, more pulls), but overall the free stream is insufficient to offset pay gaps.
   + IP Integration (q33 - q36)
     A sequel leveraging the Three Kingdoms IP with Han motifs plus modern mech/tech flair. Many decry feminized/androgynous redesigns, OOC relationships, and timeline liberties; a minority praise the youthful Cao Cao angle. Net sentiment skews negative on fidelity despite a distinct aesthetic.
   + System Requirement (q37 - q40)
     Large install and heavy in‑game downloads; frequent stalls on updates, long loads, freezes, and server instability reports hurt accessibility and trust.
   + Other Issues (q41)
     Widespread performance problems, bugs, and crashes; UI/UX friction (red‑dot spam, gear swap pain, dark theme), weak device adaptation, slow/unskippable story/tutorials, uneven PvP/GvG matchmaking, population/server sprawl, intrusive monetization prompts, deceptive marketing claims, inconsistent moderation, weak anti‑cheat, onboarding gaps, chat spam, and unclear/bugged missions and rewards."
