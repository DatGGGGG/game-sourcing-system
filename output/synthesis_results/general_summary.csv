A portrait, turn-based pet RPG with approachable one‑hand play and some squad-building depth, but dragged down by slow pacing, shaky class/pet balance, grindy progression, and heavy monetization pressure. LiveOps frequently nerf rewards and introduce instability, while the client is large and download/patching is disruptive. Cultural-Tang IP flavor lands for some, but integration and certain aesthetic choices draw criticism.

Breakdown:
- Sensitive Content (q1 - q2)
  • Minor sexualized female designs (cleavage/physics).  
  • Cultural/religious sensitivity complaints about Japanese elements within a Tang-era setting.  
  • No notable mentions of gore or substances.

- Gameplay (q3 - q20)
  • Core combat: classic turn-based with portrait ergonomics, manual/auto options, and pet/spirit evolution as a standout.  
  • Satisfaction: mixed/neutral; praised for strategy but widely called slow and repetitive, with requests for speed-up/skip and smarter auto.  
  • Strategic depth: modestly positive; build/targeting and pet/skill synergies matter, but PvE repetition and limited innovation cap depth.  
  • Progression: tilts negative; grindy dailies, increasing resource gates, difficulty spikes, and perceived pay advantage.  
  • Balance: below par; physical vs. magical disparity, outlier classes/pets (e.g., Gu Ling) dominate; frequent reactive buffs/nerfs.  
  • Team/build diversity: slightly positive on paper (roles/classes/pets), but meta dominance constrains viable comps.  
  • Secondary loop: capturing/evolving pets, tower climbs, equipment upgrades, social/guild play, routine dailies; simple yet repetitive.  
  • Resources: generally accessible via play/events and long-term planning, though recent reward reductions and RNG frustrations noted.

- LiveOps & Retention Systems (q21 - q22)
  • Frequent updates, but plagued by stealth changes, reward nerfs, and introduced bugs; perceived monetization-first adjustments erode trust.  
  • Some responsiveness to feedback, yet overall update cadence feels destabilizing.

- Monetization & Game Economy (q23 - q30)
  • Gacha includes pity/visible guarantees, improving perceived safety.  
  • Pull prices/costs viewed as high; frequent, expensive banners and top-tier items push spend.  
  • Major feature access for F2P is possible, but late-game/PvP competitiveness strongly favors spenders.  
  • Spending pressure rated heavy, with “money pit” sentiment and benefit reductions over time.

- Anti-P2W Mechanism (q31 - q32)
  • Free rewards rated slightly positive; F2P can progress and occasionally earn valuable items over time.  
  • Nonetheless, quality/quantity deemed inconsistent, and F2P remains disadvantaged in competitive modes; calls for more generous, event-driven rewards.

- IP Integration (q33 - q36)
  • Uses Tang Dynasty/Chang’an atmosphere with Shan Hai Jing and Journey to the West motifs; manga tie-in and assorted pop-cultural nods.  
  • Depth slightly positive but uneven—some find it rich and evocative, others see awkward mashups, derivative designs, and unnecessary crossovers.

- System Requirement (q37 - q40)
  • Heavy client footprint with hidden/automatic resource downloads; storage can balloon rapidly.  
  • Patching/update experience weak: crashes, stalls, PC version loading issues, network instability during events.

- Other Issues (q41)
  • PC optimization gaps; frequent bugs/crashes; server instability.  
  • Harsh/opaque bans, poor customer service, weak communication, and stealth adjustments.  
  • Forced grouping, matchmaking/friction for teams, excessive daily time sinks.  
  • Economy/trading complaints, repetitive content, UI/visual polish concerns, intrusive prompts.  
  • Account/login hassles, limited social tools, doubts about long-term retention."
